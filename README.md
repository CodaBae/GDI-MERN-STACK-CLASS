# GDI-MERN-STACK-CLASS

The MERN stack is a popular web development stack that includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

- MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-based database.
- Express.js is a web framework for Node.js that allows for easy routing and middleware creation.
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side.

These technologies are often used together because they are all JavaScript-based and work well together, making it easier for developers to switch between different parts of their application. This stack is often used to build web applications with a lot of real-time functionality, high scalability and good performance.
