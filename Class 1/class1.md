Welcome to the MERN stack class! In this class, we will be diving deep into the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. These technologies have become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. Together, they allow for the development of full-stack web applications using JavaScript, making it a great choice for developers who are comfortable working with this language.

First, we will start by learning about MongoDB, a NoSQL database that is designed to handle large amounts of data. We will cover the basics of MongoDB and how it is used to store and retrieve data in a web application. 

Next, we will move on to Express.js, a web framework for Node.js. Express.js allows for the creation of web servers and the handling of HTTP requests and responses. We will cover the basics of routing, and how to handle different types of requests and responses.

After that, we will dive into React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components and efficient updates to the user interface. We will cover topics such as state management, and how to work with forms and events.

Finally, we will cover how to connect these technologies together to build a complete web application. This will include topics such as setting up a development environment, deploying to a production server, and best practices for structuring and scaling your application.

Throughout the class, you will have the opportunity to work on a real-world project, and apply the concepts you have learned in a hands-on manner. By the end of the class, you will have a strong understanding of the MERN stack and be able to build your own full-stack web applications.
